as for some fun wrote a song  with gpt :P
Verse 1:
Listen up, I got a story to tell
'bout a framework that's makin' life a living hell
for the haters, 'cause it's so damn good
Got Spring Boot, and it's makin' my code look like it should

Chorus:
Spring Boot, Spring Boot, it's the baddest game in town
Making development a breeze, and turning it around
No need to stress, just let it flow
Just use Spring Boot and watch it go

Verse 2:
Got annotations all around, like a boss
Got my controllers and services, runnin' like a boss
Security tight, not a single flaw
Got my app runnin' like a damn sprint, and it's raw
